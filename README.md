# Pig-Game
A two-player game where player can do three things: <br>
1. Roll the dice: The current player has to roll the dice and then a random number will be generated. If current player gets any number other than 1 on the dice then that number will be added to the current score (which will initially be 0). But If the current player gets 1 then the current score will become 0 and players will be switched i.e. the current player will become in-active and vice-versa. <br>
2. Hold: If the current player clicks on HOLD, then the Current Score will be added to the Total Score. If the Total Score >= 100 then the current player wins else the other player get the chance to roll. <br>
3. Reset: All the scores are set to 0 and Player 1 is set as the starting player (current player).
